Description
-----------

This is a mod for MineTest. It adds a thirst mechanic to the
game, similar to many hunger mods (but independent of them).
Players will slowly get thirstier over time, and will need to
drink or suffer damage.

The point of this mod is not to make the game more realistic,
or harder. The point is to have another mechanic that rewards
preparation and infrastructure. Players will now have an incentive
to build their base next to water (or add some water to their base),
and/or take some water with them when mining or travelling.

Terminology: "Thirst" vs. "hydration"
-------------------------------------

"Thirst" is the absence of "hydration" (a term suggested by
everamzah on the Minetest forums, thanks!). The overall mechanic
is still called "thirst", but the visible bar is that of
"hydration", meaning a full bar represents full hydration, not full
thirst. Players lose hydration (or "hydro points") over time, and
gain hydration when drinking.

Current behavior
----------------

**Tier 0**: stand in water (running or standing) to slowly drink.
You may not move during drinking (or you could cross an ocean without
getting thirsty).

**Tier 1**: use a container (e.g. from `vessels`) on water to instantly
fill your hydration. Craftable wooden bowl included.

**Tier 2**: craftable canteens: steel canteen holds two full hydration
bars, bronze canteen three bars worth of water.

**Tier 3**: placeable drinking fountain / wash basin node: instantly
fills your hydration when used.

**Tier 4+**: placeable fountain node(s) to fill the hydration of all
players within range. Placing more nodes increases the range.

**Tier 5**: craftable trinkets/gadgets/amulets that constantly keep your
hydration filled when in your inventory, solving your thirst problem
once and for all.

API
---
Some functions of interest:

* thirsty.drink(player, amount, [max]) : instantly drink a bit (up to a max value, default 20)
* thirsty.get_hydro(player) : returns the current hydration of a player
* thirsty.set_thirst_factor(player, factor) : how fast does the given player get thirsty (default is 1.0)
* thirsty.get_thirst_factor(player) : returns the current thirst factor of a player

"player" refers to a player object, i.e. with a get_player_name() method.

Future plans
------------
Better configurability and an API.
